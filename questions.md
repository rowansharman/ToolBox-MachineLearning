# Machine Learning Toolbox Questions

1. What is the general trend in the curve?

    *As the percentage of the data that was used for training increases, the accuracy increases.*

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?

    *There seems to be less noise toward the end of the graph with more data used for training, where the accuracy is also higher.*

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

    *The line starts to smooth out around 50 trials per value. You start getting more small-scale noise though when you increase the number of values.*

4. Try different values for C. What happens?

    *With a lower value of C, the model appears to work better, producing higher accuracy results across all values. Raising the value of C produces real shitty results.*
